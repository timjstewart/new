new -- creates one or more new files and/or directories based on a
       collection of templates (e.g. C++ class files, C++ project)

Templates are stored in sub-directories of ~/.new as one or more m4
templates.  A template can have a shell script named "install" that,
if present, is executed after all files have been generated.

The directory structure of the m4 files is preserved when files are
generated except that all instances of the word name are replaced
with what the user typed in for the NAME argument.

m4 receives the following parameters when generating a file:

  name - what the user typed in for the NAME argument
 
  directory - the basename of the directory that the new thing is
              being created in.

A template directory can contain a file named "questions" that
contains multiple lines of the following format:

  variable:question:default

variable - is the name of a variable found in one or more of the m4
templates

question - is a question to ask the user in order to obtain a value
for the variable

default - is the default value of the variable if the user does not
supply a value

Example questions file:

  name_space:Enter a namespace:none
  version:Enter vesion:1.0

It's important that the questions file end with a new line so that
all questions get asked of the user.
